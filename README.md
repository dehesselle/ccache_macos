# ccache for macOS

This is not a fork of [ccache](https://github.com/ccache/ccache) but an add-on: the upstream project does not provide binary releases for macOS, so I build them myself, using [GitHub](https://github.com/dehesselle/ccache_macos) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle/ccache_macos).

## building

There is nothing for you to build here, this is a CI-only project.

## download

Check the releases section. `arm64` releases are only on GitLab.

## license
